# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a property search MCP (Model Context Protocol) project. The codebase is currently empty and awaiting implementation.

## Getting Started

As this is a new project, no build or test commands have been established yet. When implementing:

1. Consider the MCP protocol requirements for property search functionality
2. Set up appropriate package management (pip for Python, npm for JavaScript/TypeScript)
3. Establish testing framework once language and framework are chosen

## Notes

- The `.specstory` directory contains AI interaction history and should not be modified
- Update this file as the project structure and commands are established
